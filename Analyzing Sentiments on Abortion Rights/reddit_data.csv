There's an [international push](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1940108/) to reduce or ban tobacco use. [New Zealand just banned cigarettes for the next generation by raising the smoking age each year.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/13/new-zealand-passes-world-first-tobacco-law-to-ban-smoking-by-2025)  


[The FDA already banned most flavors of cigarettes](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/products-ingredients-components/menthol-and-other-flavors-tobacco-products), like mint and fruit, and [repeatedly tried to ban menthol flavors](https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/30/us-to-attempt-once-again-to-ban-menthol-cigarettes). Some pro-choice states tax heavily, like [New York's tax on cigarettes at 75%](https://www.salestaxhandbook.com/new-york/tobacco).  This tax is specifically designed to compel people to adopt behaviors that the state approves of. Pricing is regulated in several ways, like [requiring that discounts can't be offered](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/1399-BB) and [cigarettes can't be sold below what the seller paid](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/TAX/485). It's also [illegal to send cigarettes in the mail](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/1399-LL). That's just some restrictions on purchasing.  


Would you argue that pro-life would be trying to interfere with abortion access if they banned sending abortion drugs in the mail? If they tried to drive up the financial costs of an abortion with the specific aim of reducing the number of abortions?

To me, it seems one of those traditions that followed Christian morality.  From a practical standpoint, higher birthrate=higher population=greater manpower.  Greater manpower is generally a good thing.  Issues arise primarily with the child-rearing responsibility.

There are far greater protections afforded to children today than there were in the past.  People can generally no longer utilize children for the purposes of labor and military service which means that children now become pure economic liabilities until the age of majority.  As a result, a large number of families find it no longer economically viable to have children.  Where a couple hundred years ago, it was not abnormal to find families with 10 children, now even half that is considered a lot.  So what do you do to boost birth rates if you can't get children to work and you need more kids to replace the aging population?

Both together is like dangling red meat in front of hungry wolves when those who wish to debate in bad faith see these kinds of arguments. Arguing things like ""what is consciousness"" will never be resolved as it pulls in philosophical definitions in addition to scientific ones.

Just as it would be wrong to kill me and you because it would deprive us of our possibility for a future.
And so a rock has no future like ours, so to destroy a rock would be morally permissible, you wouldn’t be harming anyone. However the same cannot be said for the fetus. 
Hendricks writes about this a little and expands on it with his impairment argument;
If impairing an organism to the n+1 degree is wrong for reason R, provided reason R is present, or holds, in an impairment to the nth degree, provided that the impairment to the n+1 degree is immoral, the impairment to the nth degree will also be immoral.
And so Hendricks basically goes on to say non lethally impairing the fetus is wrong because it deprives the fetus of future in which she is not impaired, and since abortion deprives the fetus of a future she would have had if not aborted, reason R is present in both the former and latter so it follows both a non lethal case and lethal case(abortion) of harm to the fetus is wrong.

I have to disagree on that. The dependent twins rights are not negated.

The only instance where it is permissible to separate conjoined twins is when both would die without it, while one could survive without the other. If both could live in their conjoined state, separation is impermissible. The extent of the ""weaker"" twins dependency is irrelevant to that.

Note how both twins shared only non-vital parts, so the argument of ""they share bodies, so there is no real dependency"" does not fit. Each had their own set of vital organs, but one twins was significantly weaker than the others, meaning she relied entirely on her sister to survive. This however was *not* the reason why they were separated. The actual reason for that was that both would have died if it hadnt happened.

Parental obligation is giving ordinary care, which includes giving birth, but not organ donation. Hence why you’d be required to do 1, but not the other.

There’s clear differences in a “craniopagus parasiticus twinning” and pregnancy, other than a dependency. Like how 1 has parental and sometimes causal obligation, while the other doesn’t. This also ignored that twins like that (I think) won’t become separate in 9 months, so it’s either it stays like that, or it’s removed, which isn’t like pregnancy.

Also centrist don’t “lack a backbone” they’re just not you. A lot of people couldn’t care less about bodily autonomy, and are purely choosing sides based on fetus personhood. It’s not making compromises, it’s just what they believe.

The situation I’d ask you is about breast feeding. If we were to place a mother in an exact situation of pregnancy, but had it be breast feeding instead, I’d say she needs to breast feed. Like if she was stuck somewhere 9 months, doesn’t want a child, but has a home birth by accident, then should she be required to feed the child breast milk even though she doesn’t want it, and it violates her bodily autonomy? I’d say yes, since it’s her child.

Some people will say no, so I’d ask this, if she had formula, does she have to feed the child that? If so, then you want to force her to move her arm to feed the child? No, that’s not technically bodily autonomy, but so what? Why force that, but not breast milk? Is still uses your energy, which is a bodily resource. So to draw a distinction seams pointless.

11v7vqc,Abortion as birth control,Alterdox3,2023-03-19 15:06:09,"First, the short answer. I think there are some practical reasons (expense, discomfort, wear and tear on your body, inconvenience) why using abortion as your sole method of birth control is less than optimal. However, I don't think it is immoral.

Now the long answer, in several parts:

I don't at all like the judgmental tone of this question. Why? Because many of the reasons that a person might be using abortion ""as birth control"" are either a) beyond the woman's control, or b) the direct result of policy decisions made by politicians who lean PL, or PL religious dictates, or c) both of these.

Let's talk about some of those (often PL) policies/actions.

**Abstinence-only (or no) sex education.** This is the darling of a lot of politicians who lean PL. I guess they think that, if they tell young people not to have sex, and refrain from telling them how to avoid pregnancy if they end up having sex anyway, the young people just won't have sex. They are wrong. Statistics have proven that they are wrong. Abstinence-only sex education has been shown over and over to not have any beneficial effect on the teen pregnancy rate. If, on the other hand, young people are educated about effective contraception, they tend to have fewer unwanted pregnancies, and to be less likely to rely on abortion as ""birth control of last resort.""

**Obstacles to teens (and adults) getting birth control.** In many PL states like my own, there are obstacles to getting birth control. Most programs providing birth control to teens require parental consent, which, for many teens, is an insurmountable bar. In my state (which has a very high teen pregnancy rate), even a teen who is ALREADY A PARENT cannot get birth control through state programs without parental consent. Not surprising that my state ALSO has the nation's highest rate of *repeat* teen pregnancy. Lots of PL-oriented businesses have utilized the *Hobby Lobby* decision to avoid providing birth control benefits as part of their employee health insurance programs. In short, as a direct result of PL policies, birth control is hard to get, either because of expense or because of other requirements. If you are working at a minimum-wage job (in my PL state, minimum wage is still $7.25/hr; and PL politicians don't want to raise it), even condoms may be an expense you can't afford. You may be tempted to gamble, especially if you are not in a regular relationship, and aren't having sex regularly. Of course, overall, this increases your risk of an unwanted pregnancy.

**Purity Culture.** This is tied in with abstinence-only education. The whole philosophy of Purity Culture (promoted by many PL churches) creates a situation where kids are unprepared for sex and therefore, unlikely to use birth control when they DO have it. Think about it--if you are told as a young woman that having sex before marriage makes you into a dirty piece of chewed gum or a used cup filled with other people's spit, are you likely to slip a condom into your purse or glove compartment so you can be ready to have safe sex? Hell no, because YOU will NEVER, EVER, EVER have sex before marriage. That is, until you do, in the heat of the moment, all the while saying, ""Well, this is different; this is true love."" But even thinking that your teenaged sex is ""true love"" will not change your behavior; you still won't go out and get prepared for the next bout of ""true love,"" partly because you don't have access, or can't afford it, or have never been taught about it. Being prepared for safe sex is the same as admitting that you INTEND to ""sin"".

**Power Dynamics of Birth Control.** This isn't related to PL policies, but it is a factor. What are the cheapest forms of birth control? Condoms, natural family planning, and pulling out. What do all of these forms of birth control have in common? They all depend on the cooperation of the male partner. You mentioned condoms in your question: ""Maybe it is that she doesn't like how condoms feel"". Well, for the female partner, PIV sex feels pretty much the same, whether condoms are used or not (unless someone has a latex allergy). The female partner is probably fine with condoms. It is FAR more likely that the MALE partner will object, because condoms DO reduce sensation for the male. Lots of times the male partner will fuss, gripe, complain, whine, refuse, or even sneak the condom off. What can the female partner do? It is all very fine to say, ""Well, she should just refuse to have sex if the man won't wear a condom."" That is what I would do; but I am a bossy bitch, and am quite comfortable with ditching a male partner who insists on his own pleasure at the expense of a risk to my health and well being. But many women are simply not socialized to assert themselves that way. And, if the relationship is abusive, this may be even more problematic. You run into similar dynamics with the other forms of birth control that I mentioned.

In summary, I would NEVER judge a woman for using abortion as a form of birth control, because many, many, times (and often because of PL policies), this is her only alternative.",first  short answer  think practical reasons  expense  discomfort  wear tear body  inconvenience  using abortion sole method birth control less optimal  however  nt think immoral  long answer  several parts  nt like judgmental tone question   many reasons person might using abortion  birth control  either  beyond woman s control  b  direct result policy decisions made politicians lean pl  pl religious dictates  c   let s talk  often pl  policiesactions    abstinenceonly   sex education    darling lot politicians lean pl  guess think  tell young people sex  refrain telling avoid pregnancy end sex anyway  young people wo nt sex  wrong  statistics proven wrong  abstinenceonly sex education shown beneficial effect teen pregnancy rate   hand  young people educated effective contraception  tend fewer unwanted pregnancies  less likely rely abortion  birth control last resort     obstacles teens  adults  getting birth control    many pl states like  obstacles getting birth control  programs providing birth control teens require parental consent   many teens  insurmountable bar  state  high teen pregnancy rate   even teen already parent get birth control state programs without parental consent  surprising state also nation s highest rate  repeat  teen pregnancy  lots ploriented businesses utilized  hobby lobby  decision avoid providing birth control benefits part employee health insurance programs  short  direct result pl policies  birth control hard get  either expense requirements  working minimumwage job  pl state  minimum wage still  725hr  pl politicians nt want raise   even condoms may expense ca nt afford  may tempted gamble  especially regular relationship  nt sex regularly  course  overall  increases risk unwanted pregnancy    purity culture    tied abstinenceonly education  whole philosophy purity culture  promoted many pl churches  creates situation kids unprepared sex therefore  unlikely use birth control  think  told young woman sex marriage makes dirty piece chewed gum used cup filled people s spit  likely slip condom purse glove compartment ready safe sex  hell  never  ever  ever sex marriage    heat moment  saying   well  different  true love   even thinking teenaged sex  true love  change behavior  still wo nt go get prepared next bout  true love   partly nt access  ca nt afford  never taught  prepared safe sex admitting intend  sin     power dynamics birth control    nt related pl policies  factor  cheapest forms birth control  condoms  natural family planning  pulling  forms birth control common  depend cooperation male partner  mentioned condoms question   maybe nt like condoms feel   well  female partner  piv sex feels pretty much  whether condoms used  unless someone latex allergy   female partner probably fine condoms  far likely male partner object  condoms reduce sensation male  lots times male partner fuss  gripe  complain  whine  refuse  even sneak condom  female partner  fine say   well  refuse sex man wo nt wear condom   would  bossy bitch  quite comfortable ditching male partner insists pleasure expense risk health well  many women simply socialized assert way   relationship abusive  may even problematic  run similar dynamics forms birth control mentioned  summary  would never judge woman using abortion form birth control  many  many  times  often pl policies   alternative ,0.161,0.127,0.712,0.9555

Maybe it is that she doesn't like how condoms feel or the way birth control reacts with her body or **maybe just enjoys abortions** idk. But do you find that acceptable why or why not?

I hope you aren't serious about your question that someone may actually enjoy having an abortion.  I think if you are then you should educate yourself on what is involved in an abortion.   This opinion that abortions are used as birth control is ridiculous to me because of the cost of one , the time involved and the impact on the woman's body.   It's not cheap. 

So your question is not  practical. 

&#x200B;

But I'll explore it. 

Abortions are **NOT  birth control** because ""birth control"" by definition is used to **prevent pregnancy** and pregnancy , by the time an abortion occurs has already happened. 

But taken out of the definition of what birth control is there are several reasons I do not see it would be used as ""birth control. 

 It **would be expensive** ""birth control"" .  Back in 1990s ( I guess 1996 ) I took a friend to get one and even back then it was 800.00 dollars.   IT is NOT covered by tax payer money unless it's medically necessary FYI .   Today it's around that to $1,500.00 dollars.    per Google search

It would be **time consuming** .  It takes a woman one to two visits to get an abortion .  In some states they have to under go counciling and then come back.  The procedure itself will take time the waiting for the procedure as well adds to the time.  So a woman would have to schedule and make time for an abortion.   It's **impractical ""birth control**"", 

It's s**tressful on a woman's emotions and her physical body.**   Many of these abortion clinics has Pro Life advocates frequently protesting outside of these clinics doors.  I've seen them and their signs and it's ugly .  I'm not sure if what they are chanting and yelling is any better.   

THEN in some states a woman has to undergo ""counciling"" by the clinic to talk about her ending the life of the fetus .  THEN they are made to go home to think about it.   That's got to be mentally stressful for a woman who is already ( I assumed ) stressed about the pregnancy. 

It's stressful on the body.  The procedure itself is invasive on the body unless they take the abortion pill and that pill HURTS.   I had a miscarriage which I needed to take the pill to get my body to start pushing out the dead fetus and it was THE WORST cramps in my life.  It was extremely painful 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So What do I think?   Again I think your question isn't practical but IF a woman is using abortions for birth control ..  She's richer than I am and has more time on her hands than I do.  I think IF a woman like that really exists .. then it's very rare . 

I think the more likely cases is something else OTHER than ""she likes abortions"".    

I don't like condoms either and I don't use birth control.   I suffer from Vaginisumus since being sexually assaulted as a preteen.   So condoms aren't comfortable for me.   My husband and I can't get pregnant either but who knows I may end up one day as miracles happen.  IF I didn't want to risk it then I would have my husband get a vasectomy.  BUT let's say for whatever reason this woman didn't.   Some people incorrectly think they can't get pregnant or they prepared like they should.   I think she should STILL be allowed to have an abortion without stigma.

Morally, yes. She has control over her body. She can abort 10 pregnancies if she gets pregnant 10 times and doesn't want to gestate. There's no maximum number at which point you *lose the right to kick someone out of your body.*

That said, it is medically safer for most people to not get pregnant in the first place, than to have an abortion. More abortions means more risk of complications, slim as those risks are. I would hope she isn't using abortion care as BC for HER sake.

I wish she had saved her time and money and protected her future better by using birth control, not because I'm judging her, but because I wish she was empowered enough to protect herself from the disadvantages, however temporary in this case, of unintended and unwanted pregnancy. As you can see from us having devoted an entire sub to it, it's not great.

>Maybe it is that she doesn't like how condoms feel or the way birth control reacts with her body or maybe just enjoys abortions idk.

I know you say this is just a hypothetical, but I still think it is helpful to provide this information:

Over six in ten sexually active women of reproductive age report using at least one method of contraception in the past 12 months (62%), while one in seven (14%) report that they did not use contraception and are not trying to conceive. 16% believe they or their partner is unable to conceive, and the remaining 8% are trying to conceive. [Link](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/womens-sexual-and-reproductive-health-services-key-findings-from-the-2020-kff-womens-health-survey/).

Here was the breakdown on the reasons the 14% gave for not using contraceptives:

Worried about or disliked side effects of birth control - 29%  
Didn't really mind if I got pregnant - 23%  
Didn't want to use birth control - 23%  
Did not think I could get pregnant - 11%  
Couldn't find a method I was satisfied with - 9%  
Only had same-sex partners - 7%  
Religious reasons - 5%  
Did not expect to have sex - 3%  
Partner was opposed to birth control - 3%  
Couldn't afford birth control - 2%  
Another reason - 21%  
[Link](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/womens-sexual-and-reproductive-health-services-key-findings-from-the-2020-kff-womens-health-survey/) is the same.   


So, by my estimation, at most 30% of 14% of women who did not use birth control in the 12 months preceding this study - 4.2% of sexually active women - could have avoided using contraception because condoms didn't feel good or they were looking forward to availing themselves to an abortion. And this hasn't even been further reduced to the portion of this 4.2% who actually got pregnant and had an abortion.

And, another note, thought pretty old (2006):

Just as with women having their first abortion, however, the majority of women having their second or even their third abortion were using contraceptives during the time period in which they became pregnant. In fact, women having a repeat abortion are slightly more likely to have been using a highly effective hormonal method (e.g., the pill or an injectable). This finding refutes the notion that large numbers of women are relying on abortion as their primary method of birth control. Rather, it suggests that women having abortions—especially those having more than one—are trying hard to avoid unintended pregnancy, but are having trouble doing so. [Link](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2007/05/repeat-abortion-repeat-unintended-pregnancy-repeated-and-misguided-government-policies).

In all seriousness though, it can be telling that the reasons you come up with for why a woman might not be using birth control are so extreme and negative/nefarious, to the extent it bears some relationship to how you actually think about the abortion issue. I challenge you to consider how humans behave in other relatively unsafe scenarios, because they are no different than sex. How many people have kids/teens in the house with unlocked guns, or leave alcohol or substances around that they can get into to? How many people use their phones while driving - which puts a heck of a lot more people at risk than potentially conceiving one pregnancy you may choose to abort? I think spending too much time on this sub can make you start to think about people having unprotected sex like they're brain surgeons showing up to work drunk, but the reasons people don't use contraception are about as innocuous and mundane as why they tried to answer that text while driving when the most responsible thing to do would have been to pull over if it was urgent or wait until they got home. Everyday people doing everyday things take everyday risks while making the very human assumption they will pan out. We tend to be very judgmental when things don't go as planned, but hindsight is 20/20. I think it would be healthier to try and keep the edges of your abstractions about the debate more closely tethered to the reality of the situation, otherwise you may end up advocating to impose policies dreamt up for supervillains on everyday people.

>But do you find that acceptable why or why not?

I find it acceptable because I do not find the termination of a pregnancy in and of itself to be objectionable for any reason. I do not believe women have a special charge to protect or further fetal life just because the only place it can happen is inside of them. I actually find our reverence for human conception to be a little weird, because it's just like conception for every other mammal, except that we, by nature of our self-awareness (1) have the ability to know whether or not we want to do it and (2) have the knowledge of the complications and disadvantages pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood can and do bring to a person's life.

Number 1 is the reason I think all abortions have to be permissible - telling a sentient and self-aware woman she can't have an abortion as a matter of law is the government taking possession of that woman's body and conscripting it to the service of her fetus, and forced servitude of that nature is at odds with her humanity, even if it saves another human's life. We don't make people endure slavery to prevent death merely because they are not being killed themselves, or this would have been an excuse to continue slavery the world over (the fruits of a slave's labor can always be traced to someone else surviving or thriving).

> Otherwise you will be admitting that you don't actually think she has a right to her body, and that someone else has rights over her.

Is it hypothetically possible that no one - neither women nor men - have an inherent right to do whatever they want to their body? For instance: I'm not sure that a person has an inherent right to cut off their own hand. If a person decided to cut off their hand - let's say as a political statement (hey, if people will self-immolate to make a political statement, merely cutting off their hand isn't so far-fetched) - would we say, well that's their right, don't interfere? Similarly, if a healthy person wants to commit suicide, do we say, well that's their right?

Let's say someone believes that the universe we live in didn't randomly appear out of nowhere for no reason, that it has a transcendent Creator. If so, wouldn't it be plausible to say that everything in the world - including one's body - belongs to the Creator and therefore I don't have an inherent right to cause harm to anything in the universe unless granted that permission by the Creator?

Bear in mind that I'm speaking hypothetically. You don't have to believe that there is a Creator in order to respond to the logic on its own terms. I get that many people reject the premise; but hypothetically, if the premise were true, wouldn't that be a logical argument as to why the ethics of a given act of abortion may not *necessarily or exclusively* hinge on the wishes of the pregnant person?

Except for the libertarian argument, which is a rights argument. Murrary Rothbard outlined it so:

_“Most discussion of the issue bogs down in minutiae about when human life begins, when or if the fetus can be considered to be alive, etc. All this is really irrelevant to the issue of the legality (again, not necessarily the morality) of abortion. The Catholic antiabortionist, for example, declares that all that he wants for the fetus is the rights of any human being—i.e., the right not to be murdered. But there is more involved here, and this is the crucial consideration. If we are to treat the fetus as having the same rights as humans, then let us ask: What human has the right to remain, unbidden, as an unwanted parasite within some other human being’s body? This is the nub of the issue: the absolute right of every person and hence every woman, to the ownership of her own body. What the mother is doing in an abortion is causing an unwanted entity within her body to be ejected from it: If the fetus dies, this does not rebut the point that no being has a right to live, unbidden, as a parasite within or upon some person’s body._

_The common retort that the mother either originally wanted or at least was responsible for placing the fetus within her body is, again, beside the point. Even in the stronger case where the mother originally wanted the child, the mother, as the property owner in her own body, has the right to change her mind and to eject it.”_", life begin  except libertarian argument  rights argument  murrary rothbard outlined    discussion issue bogs minutiae human life begins  fetus considered alive  etc  really irrelevant issue legality   necessarily morality  abortion  catholic antiabortionist  example  declares wants fetus rights human beingie  right murdered  involved  crucial consideration  treat fetus rights humans  let us ask  human right remain  unbidden  unwanted parasite within human  body  nub issue  absolute right every person hence every woman  ownership body  mother abortion causing unwanted entity within body ejected  fetus dies  rebut point right live  unbidden  parasite within upon person  body the common retort mother either originally wanted least responsible placing fetus within body   beside point  even stronger case mother originally wanted child  mother  property owner body  right change mind eject it  ,0.073,0.112,0.815,-0.6555

It’s the same as how if you needed a kidney to survive, I’m not obliged to give you my kidney. I can let you die, and the pro choice perspective is that there’s no issue with that. The pro life response to that is, “okay, but it’s your fault that that person needs a kidney.” The pro choice person responds, “even if that’s true, it doesn’t mean I have to give you my kidney.” And so on.",debate decidedly  life begins   matter scientific fact  life  begin conception  life even conception sperm egg cell alive meet  neither side disputes  issues personhood  pro life says personhood begins conception  pro choice says even  true   matter  person complete control body   needed kidney survive   obliged give kidney  let die  pro choice perspective  issue  pro life response   okay   fault person needs kidney  pro choice person responds   even  true   mean give kidney  ,0.18,0.083,0.738,0.5828

Well no.

We can accept life begins at conception, but personhood doesn't. After all, ""Life"" is something we end every day, for conveniences far less than avoiding having a child.

We can also accept that even personhood begins at conception, but that the same basis of bodily autonomy means that it's still OK to abort, just as it's OK to allow someone to refuse to donate blood, even if it'll mean someone will die due to a lack of blood.

Even then, we can accept abortion is bad, but point out ""Criminalizing abortion doesn't reduce it at all, it just makes them more dangerous, and actually, countries with liberal abortion rights see LESS abortions.""

It's been a really difficult couple of weeks with the news at the state (have a look at [what Jean Schmidt said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/04/29/ohio-rape-bill-opportunity/)) and federal level for me.

The past couple of days have felt like a gut punch to me and it's all been a bit difficult to take. I have PTSD from years of rape and sexual assault as a child. If abortion was not legal when I was 14, I would have committed suicide. Forcing a woman to give birth under any circumstance is inexcusable and we are supposed to be better than that.

The leaked draft says it's overturning Roe and Casey to give the right back to the states, however, they are [already planning a national six-week ban](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/02/abortion-ban-roe-supreme-court-mississippi/). Most women don't even know they are pregnant at six weeks.

This comes down to controlling women. If they cared about life, they'd have better sex ed (been gutted over the last 40 years to the point where some school districts don't even have it), increase SNAP benefits to help lift women out of poverty, hold males financially accountable, and generally support the living child.

I find him brave to do so. 

____

Whether Roe vs Wade is sound as a legal precedent or not, it still will be a sad day when bodily autonomy stands to be curtailed based on where in the US you live.

Many states have already voted in trigger laws, which will effectively ban abortion the moment the Supreme Court strikes down Roe vs Wade.

In some cases this will force minors and rape victims to carry to term unsolicited pregnancies without having any say in the matter. Even if it jeopardizes their lives. This is adding insult to injury.

I’m a middle aged man and not a US citizen so this will have no legal ramifications for me personally.  

It however saddens me deeply that bodily autonomy is not universally seen as a basic human right. My personal view is that I or someone else should not have the right to limit a woman’s choice to terminate an unwanted or potentially dangerous pregnancy, or to make such an action punishable by law.

Even if a majority should object to abortion based on personal moral considerations, that by itself is not enough of an argument to selectively limit bodily autonomy for people based on their gender.

One should have the freedom to either abort or not abort. That would still allow you the freedom to conduct yourself according to your own religious or moral stance on the issue.

____

Edit:

Regarding being anti-abortion, a common argument is the sanctity of life. Once a fetus has developed the mother has no right to terminate this life.

I find that morally shaky to be honest, since we don’t consider swatting flies or exterminating rodents similarly objectionable.

Rodents and even insects have a sense of self and autonomous agency. They have impulses and can consciously experience life. A fetus does not and cannot. The brain of a fetus doesn’t start functioning fully until relatively late into the pregnancy. Way later than when the heart starts beating.

When the brain of a fetus is not yet fully functioning it cannot be considered having personhood, making abortion until that point is reached, morally justified as being at the sole discretion of the pregnant woman.

Even in special cases in the third trimester, when the fetus has died or forms a direct threat to the mother while suffering from extreme defects, abortions are still justifiable. The life of a mother should not be forcibly endangered when that is the consequence of carrying a pregnancy to term.",abortion wedge issue us  lewis stands get lot praise criticism speaking  find brave   whether roe vs wade sound legal precedent  still sad day bodily autonomy stands curtailed based us live  many states already voted trigger laws  effectively ban abortion moment supreme court strikes roe vs wade  cases force minors rape victims carry term unsolicited pregnancies without say matter  even jeopardizes lives  adding insult injury   middle aged man us citizen legal ramifications personally  however saddens deeply bodily autonomy universally seen basic human right  personal view someone else right limit woman  choice terminate unwanted potentially dangerous pregnancy  make action punishable law  even majority object abortion based personal moral considerations  enough argument selectively limit bodily autonomy people based gender  one freedom either abort abort  would still allow freedom conduct according religious moral stance issue   edit  regarding antiabortion  common argument sanctity life  fetus developed mother right terminate life  find morally shaky honest  since  consider swatting flies exterminating rodents similarly objectionable  rodents even insects sense self autonomous agency  impulses consciously experience life  fetus  brain fetus  start functioning fully relatively late pregnancy  way later heart starts beating  brain fetus yet fully functioning considered personhood  making abortion point reached  morally justified sole discretion pregnant woman  even special cases third trimester  fetus died forms direct threat mother suffering extreme defects  abortions still justifiable  life mother forcibly endangered consequence carrying pregnancy term ,0.142,0.208,0.65,-0.9514

11rh195,Weekly Abortion Debate Thread,WatermelonWarlock,2023-03-15 13:54:27,"This isn't so much a debate topic but a vent.

I notice that a LOT of pro-lifers don't engage when a post isn't abstract. For example, my last post [was about how abortion bans are pretty universally bad for women](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/11qtom2/doctors_arent_at_fault_for_mothers_unable_to_get/), and the fault is not with the doctors (a common pro-life excuse for the effects of the bans). This post was outlining the inescapable harm done by abortion bans. Almost no pro-lifers engaged, and those that did engage had nothing of value to say.

This is incredibly frustrating because pro-lifers [engage like crazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/117bvx8/objections_to_the_violinist_argument/) when I make abstract, hypothetical, or philosophical posts that have no bearing on the actual material reality happening in the wake of this discussion. And this is something that frustrated me from the start; nearly a year ago, I [made a post that included this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/txoo85/consent_and_how_the_prolife_and_prochoice_use_the/):

>This isn't a point to debate, as much as it is something I want to point out about the debate itself i na meta sense. While debating purely based on the merits of an argument is fine, I’ve also pointed out in the past that it’s important to include the context of the argument being had. For example, while I’ll argue the merits of abortion as a purely intellectual exercise, I’ve also pointed out that it’s irresponsible to do so without acknowledging the history of the pro-life cause, the real effects it has on women, and how pro-life demographics tell us something about the intentions of the pro-life movement at large.

So this is a pattern I've been angry with for pretty much my entire time on this sub, but my recent post really put that into stark perspective.

Pro-lifers seem to be allergic to talking about real, material consequences. They only seem to want to engage in these abstracted, arms-length discussions about morality and philosophy. They'll be chatty all day if you're asking them why they think removing an embryo is the moral equivalent of stabbing a toddler, but the moment you point out something beyond these abstract arguments, ***fucking crickets***.

This pisses me off. They are washing their hands of the harm they're doing to women. What pisses me off, even more, is that PLers will seem to be willing to go to any lengths to prevent abortions (as long as the impositions necessary to do so rest on the **pregnant women**) but completely unwilling to alter society to make it more supportive for pregnant women and children.

When you point out the hypocrisy, they'll say some flavor of ""pro-life is anti-abortion, not pro-helping people"", but all you have to do is ask them WHY THEY VALUE FETUSES and you'll see that [they CLAIM to think life is priceless and needs to be defended](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/znmtot/comment/j0po6lh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

The “ripping babies limb from limb” or abortions are just done out of “convenience.” Then I see how little they care about the women. I think some PLers have a strange fetus fetish.

I also want to see one PLer write the sentence “if a 10 year old gets pregnant she should still go through with the pregnancy even if it kills her or ruins her chance of having future children.” I actually want them to write that. 

Also on the PC page I saw a poster talk about how she was brutally raped and left to die after being stabbed five times. I want a PLer to write that if she was pregnant then she should still go through with it even if every time the baby moved it reminded her of being raped and left to die. To quote Tudor Dixon there can be some “healing in that.” Right?

I also want to know if you’re a man (if you care to say) or a woman that cannot become pregnant. I want to see you write that because neither of those situations would ever happen to you it’s easy to just take away that right for someone else cavalierly. That fetus is so important because one day it may grow up to be a woman who will one day herself get to experience the “joy” of being relegated to second class citizenship for the almighty fetus. 

If you have any daughters and are PL I want you to say to them “Even if you’ve been raped I don’t care about what you want. I’m forcing you to go through with this even if it means I’ll never have a relationship with you again because you’ll hate me. My feelings and the almighty fetus are way more important than my relationship with you. “ 

If you’re that proud of your stance then you should have no problems writing those sentences. Hell, get a birthday card and write “Happy Birthday my sweet little boo. Guess what ? A future zef’s more important than you!

This should be investigated like any death. If no good evidence can be found that the baby's death was a homicide, there should be no charges.  


>Women with unplanned pregnancy is advised to stop smoking cigarettes. She does her best but occasionally relapses and smokes. She has a miscarriage and the police investigate

She ought to be prosecuted just for smoking while pregnant, in addition to having killed someone. I don't see any difference between this and a scenario where an alcohol addict relapsed, drove drunk and killed someone in an ensuing crash. Sure, it's hard to recover from an addiction. I get that. Still, if you killed someone, *you killed someone*.

The misogyny of that position becomes invisible to them, either out of indignation, or because they genuinely don't believe that comparing a person's body to a vehicle or material good/object is demeaning.

One way I point out the difference in circumstances is by using the ""you have a stowaway on your ship"" example PLers use, so let's use that. Let's say instead of stowing away aboard your ship, someone ""stowed away"" *into your genitals/rectum*, and there were no immediate means of getting an authority to remove them. The only way to remove them was to kill them. This stowaway is gonna stay there until they are ""finished"" otherwise. You do not want them there, and this stowaway being inside you is causing you distress, pain, discomfort, and harm.

In response to a pregnant woman saying she doesn't want to be pregnant, the pro-life crowd says ""wait nine months"". This is equivalent to saying ""just wait until the stowaway finishes with your rectum"" in my analogy.

Suddenly the intimate use of **your body** becomes much less dismissible because it's clear to literally anyone that someone being inside you is different than being on your property.

The harms are different. The violation is different. The immediacy is different.

So much about trespassing and a bodily violation are categorically different that these analogies are doomed from the start, and if a PLer doesn't admit to this once it's pointed out I think that they're refusing to do so because conflating a woman's body with property is a useful framing device to push their views, the dishonesty and misogyny of it be damned.",problem pointing plers resonate pcers pointing misogyny  misogyny position becomes invisible  either indignation  genuinely nt believe comparing person s body vehicle material goodobject demeaning  one way point difference circumstances using  stowaway ship  example plers use  let s use  let s say instead stowing away aboard ship  someone  stowed away   genitalsrectum   immediate means getting authority remove  way remove kill  stowaway gon na stay  finished  otherwise  want  stowaway inside causing distress  pain  discomfort  harm  response pregnant woman saying nt want pregnant  prolife crowd says  wait nine months   equivalent saying  wait stowaway finishes rectum  analogy  suddenly intimate use   body   becomes much less dismissible s clear literally anyone someone inside different property  harms different  violation different  immediacy different  much trespassing bodily violation categorically different analogies doomed start  pler nt admit s pointed think re refusing conflating woman s body property useful framing device push views  dishonesty misogyny damned ,0.067,0.24,0.693,-0.9881

Consider the example of Bob who is in a room and the air is sucked out of it like you described.
I think the point of this might be to show how the womb is the natural environment the fetus needs to survive, just how like air is a natural component we need to survive. It isn’t necessarily comparing the mother to the room or air, it is comparing the uterus to air or the room, in the sense you need it to survive. Actually maybe not the room I guess Bob could survive without the room.

Let’s also consider the astronaut case where Bob the astronaut will die if he takes his space suit off. Again I think the space suit would better fit the uterus in the sense it is a necessary and very important component the being needs to survive. Suppose we changed the hypothetical. Suppose Bob the astronaut is pushed out of the spaceship by his co worker because they just don’t have enough supplies to make it out alive with Bob on board.Clearly what the question of these hypotheticals are suppose to show is a difference between killing and letting die. It’s important(and I noticed you made this mistake) that people don’t confuse killing with murder. Killing is just making an organism go from living to non living. Murder implies something wrong or malicious has happened.It is necessary for a murder to be a killing, but it is not sufficient. For instance we could have a killing, but it’s not murder 

saying abortion is a killing does not hurt the pro choice view, for it does not imply such killing was a murder. With this out of the way in the astronaut case clearly bobs co worker has killed Bob, he was a healthy organism before and his co worker started the fatal sequence of events that killed Bob. Likewise, in all abortions, the mother starts the fatal sequence of events that cause a usually healthy fetus to become unhealthy or dead. Even if the fetus is unhealthy, she creates a new strain of the fatal sequence of events. It would be something like where Fred is sick so I poison him, I’ve caused a new strain of fatal sequence of events.
So I think it’s clear abortion is a killing, many pro choice philosophers like marry Anne warren and Nathan nobis agree with me.

I also don’t think abortion is merely a letting die, because this presupposes the idea you haven’t done anything to start the fatal sequence of events that are making the fetus die. For instance if I let bob die because he’s drowning I haven’t caused the fatal sequence of events, I have not directly killed him. But if I cut both of bobs legs and arms off so he cannot swim in the ocean and I put him in the ocean, indeed it seems like I didn’t merely let him die, I started the fatal sequence of events that led him to his death. And so it was a direct killing not a mere letting die.", think  true say pro lifers comparing environment object mother  consider example bob room air sucked like described  think point might show womb natural environment fetus needs survive  like air natural component need survive   necessarily comparing mother room air  comparing uterus air room  sense need survive  actually maybe room guess bob could survive without room  let  also consider astronaut case bob astronaut die takes space suit  think space suit would better fit uterus sense necessary important component needs survive  suppose changed hypothetical  suppose bob astronaut pushed spaceship co worker  enough supplies make alive bob boardclearly question hypotheticals suppose show difference killing letting die   important  noticed made mistake  people  confuse killing murder  killing making organism go living non living  murder implies something wrong malicious happenedit necessary murder killing  sufficient  instance could killing   murder saying abortion killing hurt pro choice view  imply killing murder  way astronaut case clearly bobs co worker killed bob  healthy organism co worker started fatal sequence events killed bob  likewise  abortions  mother starts fatal sequence events cause usually healthy fetus become unhealthy dead  even fetus unhealthy  creates new strain fatal sequence events  would something like fred sick poison   caused new strain fatal sequence events  think  clear abortion killing  many pro choice philosophers like marry anne warren nathan nobis agree  also  think abortion merely letting die  presupposes idea  done anything start fatal sequence events making fetus die  instance let bob die  drowning  caused fatal sequence events  directly killed  cut bobs legs arms swim ocean put ocean  indeed seems like  merely let die  started fatal sequence events led death  direct killing mere letting die ,0.114,0.406,0.48,-0.9992

>Originalism, Abortion, and the Thirteenth Amendment

>Does an originalist reading of the Thirteenth Amendment support a right to abortion? Not long ago a negative answer seemed obvious enough to make the question silly. Since then, however, originalism has become more sophisticated. It is now understood that original meaning, not original intent, is the most appropriate originalist source of constitutional law. The original meaning of constitutional language sometimes focuses on paradigm cases: specific evils that the Constitution aims to keep from recurring. The Thirteenth Amendment’s purpose is to end the specific institution of antebellum slavery. A ban on abortion would do to women what slavery did to the women who were enslaved: compel them to bear children against their will.

Two points, one on interpretation of the 13th Amendment, which like all amendments is more complex than a surface reading suggests. Two, comparisons between the involuntary nature of the draft and pregnancy seem applicable.

**Point 1**: [Article 2 of the 13th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt13-S2-3/ALDE_00013216/) is historically interpreted as preventing racial discrimination including ""badges"" indicative of past slavery. For general abortion access, a white woman needs argue that she's being racially discriminated against and an abortion ban represents a badge of slavery to her.

>After deciding Jones, the Supreme Court held that Congress’s Thirteenth Amendment enforcement power allowed it to prohibit private racial discrimination in a variety of other contexts.....  
>  
>The Court has suggested, however, that the Congress that proposed the Thirteenth Amendment did not intend to prohibit practices that lacked discriminatory intent and merely had a disparate negative impact on African Americans. As a result, it is unclear whether Congress’s Thirteenth Amendment enforcement power extends to prohibiting such practices.

It seems like your best bet is Congress changing the laws around [defining slavery,](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt13-S1-1-2/ALDE_00013210/) not judicial reinterpretation, though again you run into the historical application of the 13th.

>The Court also held that Congress’s power may enable it to forbid some forms of private racial discrimination that might not fall within the prohibitions of Section 1 of the Thirteenth Amendment, but, in Congress’s view, amount to badges or incidents of slavery.

**Point 2**: Would you agree that conscription involves involuntary bodily service with risk of death of injury? 1918 gave us Arver v United States, a 13th Amendment challenge to the draft. The court held that someone consented to conscription by virtue of living in the U.S.

>'That every member of society hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property, and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion toward the expense of that protection, and yield his personal service when necessary, or an equivalent thereto.'

The justification declared that the Constitution gave Congress the power to raise an army, and that an army cannot be constituted without men. Furthermore, that being drafted isn't involuntary servitude, but a ""supreme and noble duty"" because the war was declared by the representative body of ""the people.""

>Finally, as we are unable to conceive upon what theory the exaction by government from the citizen of the performance of his supreme and noble duty of contributing to the defense of the rights and honor of the nation as the result of a war declared by the great representative body of the people can be said to be the imposition of involuntary servitude in violation of the prohibitions of the Thirteenth Amendment, we are constrained to the conclusion that the contention to that effect is refuted by its mere statement.

Consent to the draft is given by being a member of the body politic. Since the body politic declares war, consent to serve in that war was already given. Service to the body politic is seen as a noble duty, not involuntary servitude.

Basically, involuntary servitude, when done in service to a government policy and not private interests, doesn't seem to count as involuntary.

I would have framed it like: What do you believe is the best argument for the other side?

Even if they are all unconvincing to someone, there still has to be a best of the unconvincing arguments.

Anyway, I'd say the best PL argument is: When you voluntarily take a reasonably avoidable action that risks creating a dependent person, you are taking on a level of responsibility for that person that includes letting them use your body for a period of time.

This argument is strengthened if the actors took no actions to mitigate the risk, or took actions that increased the risk.

For example: If there is a big red button that has a risk of attaching a dependent person to you, and you press the button a bunch of times, and then proceed to remove yourself from the created dependent person, letting them die, it really seems like you are doing something immoral.

The reason this argument doesn't make me PL is because while sex is avoidable, it is expected in many situations, many people take steps to mitigate risk of pregnancy, and determining how far your bodily responsibility requires you to go would be arbitrary (how about a 100 month pregnancy?

IMO, the most compelling logical argument against abortion is that killing human beings is wrong, and since abortion kills human beings, it is wrong. I'm a moral realist, so I can understand that view. 

However, I think it's impractical to abide by it as a moral imperative since we live in a world with limited abilities & resources, and natural evils. I view abortion as a form of self defense against the bodily harm of pregnancy and childbirth, and a method by which a mother could free herself from involuntary servitude to an unwanted fetus. It's the only method available before bodily harm would become most severe. 

So while abortion may be wrong, it is still justified for those reasons.  

The most compelling emotional argument against abortion would be: 

\-term fetuses (36+ weeks) with no medical issues on women with more than sufficient resources. At this point, the harm of abortion achieves parity with childbirth/c-section, so the baby can be delivered without killing it. That's my own personal reasoning on it, but be aware I'm not an ob/gyn expert.  

The problem with banning these types of abortions is that, while it likely will achieve bipartisan support, the law essentially needs to be crafted by anti-abortion legislators... the burden would be upon THEM to craft it with language that is precise enough and not infringe on couples & doctors having to manage a situation with a term fetus with a serious medical condition. 

The likelihood of that happening would be slim, as anti-abortion legislators are only interested in banning abortion  EARLY in pregnancy, and are trending in that direction. So when pro-lifers accuse us of supporting abortion ""up until birth"", I just have to chuckle. Well, then show me a bill, and then I'll sign it.

Pro life folks: *""If consent to sex isn't consent to anything else, then why do we force men to pay child support just for having sex? It seems like when it comes to women, you're saying that consent to sex is just that, but when it comes to men, you're saying that consent to sex is consent to child support payments. Which is it? Is consent to sex just that, or is it also consent to something more?""*

Often the pro choice rebuttal to this clarification is that pregnancy and/or parenthood is much more of a sacrifice than child support payments (which I think we can all agree is true), and that child support is for the benefit of a conscious child. We can also point out that abortion prevents the existence of a child living without the resources they need, whereas removing child support denies an existing child the resources they need, which is very different in terms of the experience and suffering it leads to. All of these I think are good arguments for why the right to abortion and the right to financial abortion have different levels of suffering and sacrifice attached and should be considered separate. But all of these rebuttals still don't address the consent argument: that for men only, consent to sex is consent to potential child support, regardless of the rationale.

Regardless, I actually still think the pro choice consent argument is valid so long as pro choice folks are consistent in applying it to both men and women. For example I would be more than happy to live in a society where consent to sex is just consent to sex, for everyone. Aka a society where both abortion and financial abortion is legal, so long as society provides all children with the resources they need to survive whether they have two parents or not (universal healthcare, childcare, school lunches, etc). Some countries such as Denmark and Sweden are already starting to consider this option, and proposing that the cut off for the financial abortion be the same as the cut off for regular abortion, so both the potential father and mother have the same amount of time to decide whether they want to take on the responsibilities of pregnancy or parenthood.

Other commenters have already discussed how unacceptable the notion of pressuring people to be sterilized is, whether they really want this to happen or not. There is a long and ugly history of this type of thing in the history of my country (the US). It is not something that most compassionate people want to perpetuate.

I would like to look at this particular part of your post:

>What seems to be a recurring theme among all but the most staunch and unwavering pro-lifers is their distaste for the lack of significant consequence for pretty much all of the significant pro-choice positions. I personally agree with this sentiment as I do not believe that the people who did not want to conceive should get a simple slap on the wrist.

My first question is, why do you think people should be *punished* for an unwanted pregnancy? ~~Many, many u~~Unwanted pregnancies are, by definition, accidents, and *many, many are* not even accidents that result from negligent behavior. Why should we punish people for accidents?

My second point (not really a question) is that ALL **unwanted** pregnancies are, in themselves, already extremely *consequential* (in a negative way) for the person who gets pregnant. Clearly, you have never experienced an unplanned/unwanted pregnancy. If you had, you would know how horrifyingly stressful this experience is. From the moment when a person first suspects that they might be pregnant when they don't want to be, to the end of the pregnancy (however it ends), the pregnant person is under LOTS OF STRESS. Even if the pregnant person has access to legal and free (or inexpensive abortion), there are physical, practical, economic, and psychological complications that they will have to negotiate.

Imagine living your normal busy stressful life and then having a really bad car wreck that could have varying degrees of physical and economic consequences. It might take you months to recover from the experience and get your life put back together. Even under the best of circumstances, an unplanned pregnancy is like that.

I swear, I don't know how so many people can be so oblivious to the significance of pregnancy, whether it ends in abortion or childbirth. Maybe it is because so many PL supporters run around calling pregnancy an INCONVENIENCE that you can think as you do.

That might prevent some people from aborting even when it would be best for them to abort. It might create strife between the parties if one is willing to be sterilized and the other is not. The sterilization might be for the best, but trying to impose sterilization on people is bound to create serious problems.

Sterilization might do that, but under this system people can simply choose to not be sterilized, and what would ensure these people will not have negative impacts if they choose to not be sterilized?

>Firstly, it will make people consider the 1% chance of contraceptive failure more seriously and possibly greatly encourage people to use contraceptives properly as directed due to the greater stakes involved.

Why on earth would you assume people aren't careful with their contraception now?

Every type of contraception has a failure rate and nobody is a perfect contraception-using robot. Throughout the several decades most people are sexually active, it's *impossible* not to mess it up a few times. And AFAB / women who don't want to get pregnant are already scared shitless of getting pregnant, trust me. Pregnancy is terrifying. 

>Secondly, the options to conceive in the aftermath of sterilization (IVF, reversal, etc.) will require the parties to have enough disposable income that they would likely be financially stable, thus addressing one of the biggest issues that drive people to abortion to begin with.

Irrespective of whether a human being is beloved, capable of emotional expression, intellectually astute, or otherwise, such considerations hold no sway on the acceptability of taking their life.
